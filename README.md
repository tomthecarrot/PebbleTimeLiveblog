# PebbleTimeLiveblog
![](https://raw.github.com/tomthecarrot/PebbleTimeLiveblog/master/screenshots/banner.png)  
Liveblog tracker for [Pebble Time](http://getpebble.com).  
NOTE: This Verge version is still a work-in-progress!  

## Features
- Follow the latest liveblogs from [The Verge](http://theverge.com) on your Pebble Time!
- Utilizes new Timeline functionality to quickly deliver automatic updates to your wrist.
- Written in C.
- Open-source license.
- Pull Requests are welcome!
- See ["master" branch](https://github.com/tomthecarrot/PebbleTimeLiveblog/tree/master) for implementing your own custom liveblog server.

## Installation
Go to the Pebble App Store on your phone and search for "Liveblog", or [click this link](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/554ec47cecdc00f8140000c6).

## Precompiled App Usage
I have uploaded my custom version of PebbleTimeLiveblog to the Pebble App Store.  
I plan to restart the Server for future Verge liveblogs.  

1. Before (or during) a live event, install the app on your Pebble Time through the Pebble App Store.
- Once the app is installed on your Pebble Time, open it. It should say "Subscribed to [Verge Liveblog]".
- Now, just wait for updates!
- They will show up as past updates,
so click the up button on the right side of your Pebble Time.
- Only one card will be pushed for a live event, but it will update continuously.
- Click the middle button on your Pebble Time, and voila!
- Tip: You can keep the card open on your Pebble Time, as it updates itself! Cool, right?
Because of Pebble Time's e-paper screen, keeping the display on won't drain your battery.

## Server
1. In the Python script, replace the indicated values (API keys, etc.) with your own ones.
- Replace the script's URL with the full web address of the Verge liveblog you want to follow.
- Run start.py before or during a live broadcast.
- Follow along on your watch!
